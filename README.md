ANA - Simulation program (TU-Wien)

This repository was created to preservate the programm called ANA.

Ana is a simulator of analog and digital systems for measurement and control. <br>
While the last release has been quite a while ago it is still used to teach students of some higher technical collages and <br>
universities in Austria the foundations of this area. <br>
ANA has been developed by the (now defunct) "Institut f√ºr Elektrische Regelungstechnik" (institute for electrical control engineering) <br>
of the university of Vienna. <br>
Documentation may be found here: http://mathematik.tsn.at/content/files2/ana1089.pdf (This link doesn't work anymore) <br>
This seems the last place were to get the manual I think: https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-7091-6389-4_6<br>

To install this Programm just drag the folder "ana252" into your Program Files (x86) folder and create a desktop link<br>
to "C:\Program Files (x86)\ana252\Bin\Ana.exe".
